/*
A "Mersenne prime" is a prime number that is one less than a 
power of 2. This means that it is a prime number with the 
form 2^x - 1, where x is some exponent. For example:

3 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 3 = 2^2 - 1
7 is a Mersenne prime because it is prime and 7 = 2^3 - 1
11 is not a Mersenne prime because although it is prime, it 
does not have the form 2^x - 1
The first three Mersenne primes are 3, 7, and 31. Write a 
method mersenne_prime that accepts a number, n, as an 
argument and returns the n-th Mersenne prime.

p mersenne_prime(1) # 3
p mersenne_prime(2) # 7
p mersenne_prime(3) # 31
p mersenne_prime(4) # 127
p mersenne_prime(6) # 131071

A triangular number is a number of the form (i * (i + 1)) / 2 
where i is some positive integer. Substituting i with 
increasing integers gives the triangular number sequence. 
The first five numbers of the triangular number sequence 
are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. Below is a breakdown of the calculations 
used to obtain these numbers:

We can encode a word as a number by taking the sum of its 
letters based on their position in the alphabet. For example, 
we can encode "cat" as 24 because c is the 3rd of the 
alphabet, a is the 1st, and t is the 20th:
3 + 1 + 20 = 24

Write a method triangular_word? that accepts a word as an 
argument and returns a boolean indicating whether or not 
that word's number encoding is a triangular number. You can 
assume that the argument contains lowercase letters.

p triangular_word?('abc')       # true
p triangular_word?('ba')        # true
p triangular_word?('lovely')    # true
p triangular_word?('question')  # true
p triangular_word?('aa')        # false
p triangular_word?('cd')        # false
p triangular_word?('cat')       # false
p triangular_word?('sink')      # false

Write a method consecutive_collapse that accepts an array of 
numbers as an argument. The method should return a new 
array that results from continuously removing consecutive 
numbers that are adjacent in the array. If multiple adjacent 
pairs are consecutive numbers, remove the leftmost pair 
first. For example:

[3, 4, 1] -> [1]
because 3 and 4 are consecutive and adjacent numbers, so we 
can remove them

# p consecutive_collapse([3, 4, 1])                     # [1]
# p consecutive_collapse([1, 4, 3, 7])                  # [1, 7]
# p consecutive_collapse([9, 8, 2])                     # [2]
# p consecutive_collapse([9, 8, 4, 5, 6])               # [6]
# p consecutive_collapse([1, 9, 8, 6, 4, 5, 7, 9, 2])   # [1, 9, 2]
# p consecutive_collapse([3, 5, 6, 2, 1])               # [1]
# p consecutive_collapse([5, 7, 9, 9])                  # [5, 7, 9, 9]
# p consecutive_collapse([13, 11, 12, 12])              # []

Write a method pretentious_primes that takes accepts an 
array and a number, n, as arguments. The method should 
return a new array where each element of the original array 
is replaced according to the following rules:

when the number argument is positive, replace an element with 
the n-th nearest prime number that is greater than the element
when the number argument is negative, replace an element 
with the n-th nearest prime number that is less than the 
element

For example:

if element = 7 and n = 1, then the new element should be 11 
because 11 is the nearest prime greater than 7

if the element = 7 and n = 2, then the new element should 
be 13 because 13 is the 2nd nearest prime greater than 7

if the element = 7 and n = -1, then the new element should be 
5 because 5 is the nearest prime less than 7

if the element = 7 and n = -2, then the new element should be 
3 because 3 is the 2nd nearest prime less than 7

# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], 1)           # [5, 17, 11]
# p pretentious_primes([4, 15, 7], 2)           # [7, 19, 13]
# p pretentious_primes([12, 11, 14, 15, 7], 1)  # [13, 13, 17, 17, 11]
