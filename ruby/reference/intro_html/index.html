  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 medium brown or white onion, peeled and diced</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 medium green or red bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>4 cups ripe diced tomatoes, or 2 cans (14 oz. each) diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder (mild)</li>
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>Pinch of cayenne pepper (or more to taste-- spicy!)</li>
    <li>Pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>5-6 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley (optional, for garnish)</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a deep, large skillet or saut&eacute pan on medium. Slowly warm olive oil in the pan. Add chopped onion,
      saut&eacute
      for a few minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and continue to saut&eacute till mixture is
      fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>Add the bell pepper, saut&eacute for 5-7 minutes over medium until softened.</li>
    <li>Add tomatoes and tomato paste to pan, stir till blended. Add spices and sugar, stir well, and allow mixture to
      simmer over medium heat for 5-7 minutes till it starts to reduce. At this point, you can taste the mixture and
      spice it according to your preferences. Add salt and pepper to taste, more sugar for a sweeter sauce, or more
      cayenne pepper for a spicier shakshuka (be careful with the cayenne... it is extremely spicy!).</li>
    <li>Crack the eggs, one at a time, directly over the tomato mixture, making sure to space them evenly over the
      sauce. I usually place 4-5 eggs around the outer edge and 1 in the center. The eggs will cook "over easy" style on
      top of the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan. Allow mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are cooked and the sauce has
      slightly reduced. Keep an eye on the skillet to make sure that the sauce doesn't reduce too much, which can lead
      to burning.</li>
    <li>Some people prefer their shakshuka eggs more runny. If this is your preference, let the sauce reduce for a few
      minutes before cracking the eggs on top-- then, cover the pan and cook the eggs to taste</li>
    <li>Garnish with the chopped parsley, if desired. Shakshuka can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. For
      breakfast, serve with warm crusty bread or pita that can be dipped into the sauce (if you're gluten-intolerant
      or celebrating Passover, skip the bread). For dinner, serve with a green side salad for a light, easy meal.</li>
  </ol>
